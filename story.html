			<h2>Our Story</h2>
		</div>
		<div id="center"><left>
			<p>
				   The Hammered Sisters are Sherry and Sandy, and they actually are sisters!  They grew up in New Mexico.  There is a reason why New Mexico is known as the Land of Enchantment!  They received inspiration from everything around them, but in particular the vast expanses of beauty and color.<br>
			<br>
			     About three years ago Sherry and Sandy thought it would be a lot of fun to use these items from every day life to create unique pieces, each telling its own story.  When family and friends showed an interest in purchasing their creations they decided to get serious.  About a year ago they sold their first piece and have since lost count.<br>
			<br>
			     Why windows?  Windows have a particularly human nature about them. They say that one's eyes are the windows to their souls.  The Sisters built on this idea and as you venture through the website you'll notice that most of their works incorporate windows as the foundation.<br>
			<br>
			     They love the idea of using that which surrounds them. Whether it be a cherished item or something that would end up un in a landfill, they mix, match and color to tell a unique story.<br>
			<br>
			     The Hammered Sisters set root in the Community of Leavenworth and their works are recognized by site.  They have since spread their branches and you'll find their creations in  New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California, Ohio, Missouri, Virginia, and Kansas!!!<br>
